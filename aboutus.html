      <h2>About HIV</h2>
      <p>HIV (Human Immunodeficiency Virus) is a virus that attacks the body's immune system, specifically the CD4 cells, often referred to as T cells. Without treatment, HIV can lead to the disease AIDS (Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome). However, with proper medical care, HIV can be controlled.</p>

    <section id="treatment">
      <h2>Treatment for HIV</h2>
      <p>Antiretroviral therapy (ART) is the recommended treatment for HIV infection. It involves taking a combination of HIV medicines (antiretroviral drugs) every day. ART can't cure HIV, but it helps people with HIV live longer, healthier lives and reduces the risk of HIV transmission.</p>
